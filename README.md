# File Merger - FS Notes to Obsidian Daily Journal Converter

A PHP tool designed to transform scattered, on-the-fly markdown notes from **FS Notes** into organized daily summaries that are perfectly compatible with **Obsidian journal pages**.

## The Problem This Solves

When using FS Notes for quick capture of thoughts, ideas, and notes throughout the day, you often end up with:
- Hundreds or thousands of small, undeveloped markdown files
- Scattered thoughts that are hard to review and organize
- Individual files that lack context when viewed in isolation
- A cluttered notes directory that becomes unwieldy over time

## The Solution

This tool automatically:
1. **Groups** your FS Notes markdown files by their creation date
2. **Merges** all notes from the same day into a single organized file
3. **Timestamps** each note with its original creation time (in military format)
4. **Formats** the output to be compatible with Obsidian's daily note structure
5. **Preserves** all original content while making it searchable and reviewable

## Key Benefits

- **üóÇÔ∏è Organization**: Transform chaos into structure with daily summaries
- **‚ö° Quick Review**: Scan an entire day's thoughts in one file instead of dozens
- **üîç Better Search**: Obsidian can now search across consolidated daily content
- **üìÖ Journal Compatibility**: Files use standard date formats (YYYY_MM_DD.md)
- **‚è∞ Time Context**: Each note retains its original timestamp for reference
- **üíæ Space Efficient**: Reduces file system clutter significantly

## How It Works

### Input Structure
Your FS Notes directory contains scattered markdown files:
```
textonly/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Quick thought about project.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Meeting notes with John.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Grocery list ideas.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Random inspiration.md
```

### Output Structure
The tool creates organized daily files:
```
OutFS/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024_01_15.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024_01_16.md
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2024_01_17.md
```

### File Format
Each daily summary file contains timestamped entries:
```markdown
# 14:30
Quick thought about project content here...

# 11:15
Meeting notes with John content here...

# 09:45
Grocery list ideas content here...
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Install PHP
Ensure you have PHP installed on your system (macOS usually includes it).

### 2. Configure the Tool
1. Change name of `config-sample.ini` to `config.ini`
2. Edit `config.ini` with your specific paths:
   - **timezone**: Your local timezone (e.g., "America/New_York")
   - **input_path**: Path to your FS Notes directory
   - **output_path**: Where you want the merged files saved
   - **date_format**: Date format for output files (default: "Y_m_d")

### 3. Run the Tool
```bash
php Process.php
```

## Configuration

The tool uses a simple INI configuration file:

```ini
timezone = "America/New_York"
input_path = "/Users/YourUsername/Library/Mobile Documents/iCloud~co~fluder~fsnotes/Documents/textonly"
output_path = "/Users/YourUsername/Desktop/OutFS/"
date_format = "Y_m_d"
```

## Integration with Obsidian

The output files are designed to work seamlessly with Obsidian:

1. **Daily Notes Plugin**: Files follow the standard daily note naming convention
2. **Search Functionality**: All content becomes searchable within Obsidian
3. **Linking**: You can link to specific days using `[[2024_01_15]]` syntax
4. **Templates**: The timestamp format (# HH:MM) creates natural section headers

## File Processing Details

- **Sorting**: Files are sorted by creation time within each day
- **Ordering**: Most recent notes appear at the top of each daily file
- **Timestamps**: Uses 24-hour format (military time) for precision
- **Preservation**: All original content is preserved exactly as written

## Requirements

- **PHP**: Version 7.0 or higher
- **macOS**: Uses `mdls` command for file metadata (macOS specific)
- **FS Notes**: Source files should be in markdown format

## Future Development Ideas

- Support for additional file formats beyond markdown
- Customizable output templates (bullets, different timestamp formats)
- Option to merge all notes into a single file instead of daily files
- Configurable date ordering (ascending vs descending)
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows/Linux support)

## Use Cases

Perfect for:
- **Daily Journaling**: Convert scattered thoughts into coherent daily entries
- **Meeting Notes**: Consolidate multiple meeting notes from the same day  
- **Project Planning**: Organize brainstorming sessions by date
- **Research**: Group related research notes chronologically
- **Personal Knowledge Management**: Maintain searchable daily archives

## Why This Approach Works

Instead of managing hundreds of individual files, you get:
- **Contextual Grouping**: See all thoughts from a specific day together
- **Temporal Organization**: Natural chronological flow of ideas
- **Reduced Cognitive Load**: Fewer files to manage and navigate
- **Enhanced Discoverability**: Better search and linking capabilities
- **Obsidian Optimization**: Leverages Obsidian's strengths for knowledge management

This tool bridges the gap between quick capture (FS Notes) and organized review (Obsidian), creating a powerful workflow for knowledge workers, researchers, and anyone who values both spontaneous note-taking and structured information management.
